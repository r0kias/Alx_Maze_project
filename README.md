### About me: Orlane
I've been interested in programming for a long time, but I wasn't really good at math and everybody would tell me it is not for me. Then I went to university, kind of "by default" to get a degree in japanese language and civilization (LLCER), then the COVID arrived and I failed my exams. Instead of doing a second year, I finally decided to go after my dreams. And now here am I, at the end of my first year at Holberton School, doing this portfolio project.
